# Long time, no blog.  But now I'm getting a backlog of things I want to talk about - thanks
# to Generative AI (it writes more and better than me, but so be it).

I have been obsessed with generative AI.  I'd love to talk about the big topics - AGI,
ASI, human survival, immortality - but my way is down in rabbit holes. So let's write some
code (or just very slightly modify some existing code), and maybe we'll tackle elephants
in various rooms another time.

To jump to the how-to, check out the video

* Programming in natural language

One of the mind-blowing aspects of coding for LLMs is
that we will be "programming" primarily in human language.

The small amount of Python code is just a little wrapper to do things like set prompt
strings, pull in the API key, write files and so forth.  Tiny little inconsequential
things.  Heavy lifting is left to the LLM to understand the source text, generate the
metadata we asked for, summarize it, search it, update.


* Create and search Knowledge Base articles

David Shapiro is a great YouTuber who talks about the big topics but also makes coding
video when insomnia strikes.  He recently did a video about using ChatGPT to create
structured knowledge base (KB) articles.  His version writes out YAML files.  We're going
to do some tweaks to the prompting and metadata to accomplish the same in Org Mode, which
will then allow us to integrate the articles with a structured note taking system such as
Org Roam or - in my case - the Denote package by Protesilaos.

* No structure?  No problem!

Our data can be as unstructured and motley as we wish - no need for a relational ERD or a
schema or an ontology or a dictionary.  The LLM can find the relationships for you.  And
for that matter, it's happy to generate SQL, SPARQL and other query languages, as well as
the schemas and ontologies you might want!

So the code we will be using is a tweak on David Shapiro's code.  The repository I'm using
is a fork of his repo at https://github.com/gregoryg/KB_microservice, branch 'org-gab'.

Happy coding!
